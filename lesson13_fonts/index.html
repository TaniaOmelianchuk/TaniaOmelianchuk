                    <p class="main__text">React Native is an open source framework for building 
                        Android and iOS applications using React and the app 
                        platform&apos;s native capabiles. With React Native, 
                        you use JavaScript to access your platform&apos;s APIs as 
                        well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI 
                        using React components: <span class="main__text--italic"> bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> 
                        You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, 
                        let&apos;s cover how components work in React Native.

                    <p class="main__text">React Native runs on <span class="main__text--underlined">React</span>, a popular open source library 
                        for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most 
                        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can 
                        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main__text">We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li class="main__text"><span class="main__text--bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: 
                            friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                        </li>
                        <li class="main__text"><span class="main__text--bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
                            inside JavaScript like so: <span class="main__text--grey">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
                        </li>
                        <p class="main__text">The React docs have a <span class="main__text--underlined">comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more.
                            Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring 
                            a <span class="main__text--grey">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="main__text--grey">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                        </p>
                        <li class="main__text"><span class="main__text--bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.</li>
                        <li class="main__text"><span class="main__text--bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                            render, state is like a component&apos;s personal data storage. State is useful for handling 
                            data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="main chapter4">
                    <div class="main__title">
                        <h2>HANDLING TEXT INPUT</h2>
                        <p>Chapter 4</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="main__text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has 
                        an <span class="main__text--italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every
                        time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main__text main__text--last">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different 
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence 
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
